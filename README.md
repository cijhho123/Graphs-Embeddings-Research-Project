# Sparse Spanner Construction â€“ Analysis & Implementation

This project provides a full implementation and empirical analysis of the paper  
**"Streaming and Fully Dynamic Centralized Algorithms for Constructing and Maintaining Sparse Spanners"** by Michael Elkin.  
The algorithm constructs sparse spanners efficiently in a streaming setting using randomized radius sampling and labeling strategies.
